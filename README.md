## What is the Shikinha?

Shikinha is a simple Discord music bot, built using Python.
  
The default prefix for the bot is ```;```

## Setting up...

First, you'll need a Discord API token, which you can get from the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Create a new application and generate a token. After obtaining the token, paste it into the ```disc_token variable``` in the ```config.toml``` file.

With that done, you can set up the bot in two ways: Local or via Docker. Choose the method that suits you best.

### Method 1: Local Setup
1. First, make sure you have Python 3.11+ installed. You can check this by running:
   
    ```
    python3 --version
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file by running:
   
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. After the dependencies are installed, ensure that you have the necessary ```ffmpeg``` package is installed on your system, as it's required for audio processing. You can install it by running:

    #### For Linux:
      ```
      sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
      ```
    #### For macOS (using Homebrew):
      ```
      brew install ffmpeg
      ```

    For Windows, follow the instructions [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

4. Once everything is set up, run the bot with:
    ```
    python3 shikinha.py
    ```

### Method 2: Docker Setup
  1. Ensure that Docker is installed on your system. If not, follow the installation instructions on the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com).
  2. Build and run the Docker container with the following commands:
     
      ```
      docker build -t shikinha .
      docker run -p 443:443 shikinha
      ```
      This will build the Docker image, install all necessary dependencies (including ```ffmpeg```), and run the bot.
